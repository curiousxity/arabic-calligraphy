# Text on path (`src/lib/textPath.ts`, `TextOnPathText.tsx`, `TextPathEditOverlay.tsx`)

A fourth block type, `textPath`, flows shaped text along an arbitrary curve
instead of a straight baseline. The curve is stored as a plain SVG path `d`
string (`textPathD`) — the same representation `shapeSvgPath` already uses
on `shapeFill` blocks — rather than a bespoke point-array type,
so presets, SVG upload, and freehand pen-tool drawing all converge on one
representation and reuse `lib/svgPath.ts`'s existing parse/flatten/replay
functions wholesale.

`lib/textPath.ts` adds arc-length walking (`pathLength`/`pointAtArcLength`,
built on the same fixed-step bezier subdivision `pathToPolygon` already
provides), three preset-curve generators (`arcPathD`/`wavePathD`/
`circlePathD`), and a single-handle-per-anchor bezier editing model
(`CurveAnchor`/`anchorsToD`/`dToAnchors`) — every anchor has one *outgoing*
handle; the incoming handle for the next segment is always that anchor's
mirror image, trading a fully general independent-in/out-handle pen tool
for a much simpler one-handle-per-anchor editing UI.

`TextOnPathText.tsx` renders each glyph as a rigid unit — translate to its
arc-length position on the curve, rotate to the local tangent, draw the
outline — modeled on `ShapedText.tsx`'s glyph loop rather than a
per-point remap, since text-on-path repositions whole
glyphs rather than distorting their outlines. Text always auto-scales to
span the curve's length exactly (same idea `ShapeFillText` already applies
per-row to its shape width), which means the block's `fontSize` field has
no visible effect for this block type and its slider is hidden in the
sidebar — curve length is the only size control. RTL text anchors to the
curve's *end* point by default (a `textPathReversed` flag flips this per
block when the guess is wrong for a particular curve).

`TextPathEditOverlay.tsx` is a separate component (not part of
`TextOnPathText`) providing the on-canvas pen-tool: click empty canvas to
append an anchor, drag an anchor or its handle to reshape, right-click an
anchor to remove it. It's shown only when a `textPath` block is both
selected and has `textPathEditMode` set, and is hidden during export
(`useExport.ts` toggles off every node whose id starts with
`text-path-edit-layer-`, alongside the grid and artboard background it
already hides).

Per-glyph tools (move & scale, diacritic overrides) do not apply to
`textPath` blocks — every internal per-glyph mutator guard excludes
`"textPath"` the same way it has always excluded `"image"`. Those tools'
hit-testing assumes a straight glyph bounding box; making it work once a
glyph is rotated to a curve tangent
is a real design problem, deliberately left for a future spec rather than
half-supported here.
